# Unofficial Sudo-Flix APK (duh)

## The difference between the APKs


*Sudo-Flix-MainDomain.apk* runs using https://sudo-flix.lol while *Sudo-Flix-Mirror.apk* uses https://flix.kanded.xyz . It's merely a matter of preference on which one you pick.


## Regarding the MovieWeb APK


*MovieWeb-Legacy.apk* is a slower alternative that uses my own instance of MovieWeb 4.6.6 hosted at https://aeonfur.glitch.me . This version is slower and offers less sources than Sudo-Flix, which reduces the amount of content available to you, but is an option if you are desperate.
